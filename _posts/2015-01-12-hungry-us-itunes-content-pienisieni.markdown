As someone who not just travels a lot, but lives in a lot of countries too and loves to download digital content over the internet, country restrictions can be a pain in the ass. I always have a VPN ready so that I can fake the IP address of most countries, which can help in anything from buying cheaper flight tickets to access free digital content over the internet. But when you need to make actual purchases, such sites are able to enforce these restrictions much better.

Looking for ways around such restrictions, I found a brilliant solution to make an [iTunes purchase outside US][itunes] and circumvent the whole credit card ordeal. Back in the days, the only way you could actually make any purchases were by credit cards, but now we have many different options such as gift cards which I prefer in any case. What makes me wonder however, is that why the content has to be so much restricted when in the end it's all about profit. With the English language speaking population now exceeding those of natives, obviously there is a lot of demmand to watch videos, listen to music, read books or just about anything that originates from the US, or from the UK as well. But now, internet freedom has had to pay a price for becoming much more regulated than in the pass. Sometimes the laws are made as we go, as some of the newer inventions of doing business online carries out totally new concepts.

I am a big fan of documentaries, and a lot of them on iTunes are restricted to US only. That really sucks in my opinion, but now I finally have an easy method, and solution to get my fixed video doce from the United States for just a few extra dollars compared to when I would actually live in the states. Actually some states in America tax digital goods, and some not.. so this also enables you to choose a state that is tax free in that sense. For example California has absolutely no taxasion when it comes to buying music or downloading videos of the internet. Now hungry for even more, heh, heh.

Knowledge is power, share the knowlege!
