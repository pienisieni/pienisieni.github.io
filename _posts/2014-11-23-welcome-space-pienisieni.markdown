Welcome to my [humble homepage][me]. 'Pienisieni' means small mushroom in Finnish, after all I do like mushrooms and I am Finnish. I am very happy to be able to host my site at one of the most amazing places on the web, the GitHub!

However, this is more of a personal blog about things small and big, but most importantly things that matter for all of us in this world. Yes, there could be environmentalism, activism, some hippy stuff as well as it and programming. But best of all, I am not here to preach. I just want to spread the good word, facts and information that are often left not noticed.

I'll leave you with one of my favourite, personal quotes:

"Step back, and look what you have done. And don't forget to breath while your at it."
